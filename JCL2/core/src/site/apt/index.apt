Overview

 JCL is a configurable, dynamic and extensible custom classloader that loads java classes directly
 from Jar files and other sources. The motivation was to create isolated classloaders, which can be easily
 integrated with IoC frameworks like Spring and with web applications. Click {{{gettingstarted.html}here}}
 for more details on usage.

 This library, as is and modified, can be used for free in personal and commercial applications under the 
 terms and conditions of {{{http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html}GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)}}.

* Installation


 To use JCL, {{{http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/jcloader}download}}
 and build the JCL project and put jcl(-core-2.x).jar and dependencies in the application's
 classpath. See the build section below and also check out the {{{downloads.html}downloads section}} for more 
 details on the available builds and source.

** Maven repository
 
 As of version 2.2.1 the JCL artifacts are available in Maven Central Repository; so now JCL can easily be added to the maven projects as a dependency.

 For versions prior to 2.1, download the jar files and use commands, like the following, to install the downloaded artifacts to the
 local maven repository so that they can be pulled into your maven projects: 
 
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  mvn install:install-file -Dfile=jcl-core-2.0.jar -DgroupId=org.xeustechnologies \
       -DartifactId=jcl-core -Dversion=2.0 -Dpackaging=jar -DgeneratePom=true
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In order to include JCL v2.1 to v2.2 as a dependency apart from the command above, you can add the following 
 repository to your maven project:

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <repositories>
    <repository>
      <id>jcl-sourceforge</id>
      <url>http://jcloader.sourceforge.net/mvn-repo</url>
    </repository>
  </repositories>
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
* Building JCL

 JCL is a multi-module maven project that has four modules as shown below:
 
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  JCL
  |---> core
  |---> spring
  |---> test-jar
  |---> test-web
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
 The <test-*> modules create resources to run the unit tests and a sample web application. The <core> module
 builds an artifact with all the main JCL class files. The <spring> module generates an artifact for spring
 integration.
 
 To build JCL, check-out the source code and run the following command:
 
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  mvn clean install
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
 This command will create <jcl-core> and <jcl-spring> artifacts, and will also create a sample <war> file
 to test JCL web integration. It will also copy the dependencies of each artifact in the <dependecies> folder.


* Requirements

 JCL requires JDK 1.5 or later; and will pull in all its dependencies using maven.
